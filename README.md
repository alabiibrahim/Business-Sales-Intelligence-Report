## Project brief
The goal is to have a clean, interactive, and visually appealing dashboard that provides actionable insights at a glance.


## Objectives / Questions to answer

Client Request: Assistance in Building a Sales Dashboard in Excel. I would like the dashboard to include the following key features:

Customer, and Average Revenue per Product. 

• Comparison visuals: Year-over-year (YoY) revenue for 2023 vs 2024, monthly revenue 
trends, and revenue by weekdays vs weekends. 

• Category insights: Revenue generated by category and top products driving sales. 

• Customer insights: Top-5 revenue-generating customers, revenue contribution by 
gender, and revenue breakdown by age segments. 

• Regional insights: Regional sales performance and revenue distribution across segments. 

• Interactivity: Ability to filter by product categories (Clothing, Electronics, Groceries, 
Home Appliances, Sports) and by region (East, North, South, West).
